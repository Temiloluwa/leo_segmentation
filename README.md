# Latent Embedding Optimization for Few-shot Segmentation

In this project, Meta-Learning is deployed to solve the Few-shot Segmentation problem.
Inspired by the paper "Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization" by Rusu et. al., the goal is to translate the successes of Optimization-based
Meta-Learning for the Few-shot Classification problem to Segmentation.

## Team members
The project is undertaken by Temiloluwa Adeoti, Gopika Sudhakaran, Istiaque Mannafee, Jennifer Deborah
